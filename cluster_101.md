# Getting started with UF’s HiPerGator in the McDaniel lab

## Task 1: get necessary accounts/programs

### You will need to get access to the cluster:
[Follow this link](https://www.rc.ufl.edu/access/account-request/) and the given prompts to request an account. You will need to put Stuart McDaniel’s name in at some point to request the correct cluster account (if requesting an account for a different PI's lab, put that person's name in the request). Otherwise it should be straightforward. Once you put the request in, Stuart (or other PI) will get an email to approve your access. Once that's done you’ll have an account within 24 hours.

### You will need command-line capabilities to run your jobs on UF’s cluster:
If using a PC: Install [Putty](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/)* </br>
If using a Mac: Locate terminal* window (usually in Applications/Utilities)

### You will need a way of transferring files between your computer (like scripts you write) to the cluster:
Install either [Cyberduck](https://cyberduck.io/)* or [Filezilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)* 

### Some files are much too large, like transcriptome or genome resequence data, to transfer via Cyberduck. Globus is the way to go for these much larger files:
Get a [Globus](https://www.globus.org/)* account 

*_being a UF student/employee means these should all be free. If you are being asked to pay money, something’s off._

### The [UFRC Help and Documentation](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/UFRC_Help_and_Documentation) page contains a lot of information for running jobs on UF's cluster. Keep it handy. You’ll see, for example, a link labelled “Getting Started”.
Read the “Getting Started” page
</br>
On the [UFRC Help and Documentation](https://help.rc.ufl.edu/doc/UFRC_Help_and_Documentation) page there is also a link to “Training”. Within that link is a schedule for upcoming training sessions and archived videos/presentations of previous training sessions that may be useful to you

## Task2: LINUX
If you are not familiar with using linux you may find [this UF IT training video](https://training.it.ufl.edu/training/items/introduction-to-linux-command-line.html) helpful 
</br>
If you feel you want even more linux training here’s a [command-line boot camp](http://rik.smith-unna.com/command_line_bootcamp/?id=9xnbkx6eaof)

## Task 3: SLURM

### SLURM is the workload manager we use to submit jobs on the cluster
Do the [HiPerGator SLURM submission scripts training](https://training.it.ufl.edu/training/items/hipergator-slurm-submission-scripts.html)
